# repo-doc-gen

Simple utility, that takes a list of JSON files, that can be retrevied via the API request `https://api.github.com/orgs/pulsar-edit/repos?page= `

From here this will auto generate a MarkDown file at the root of the project, of every repo, with attached badges, and descriptions. Use `node .` to run it.
